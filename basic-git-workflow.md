# Basic Git work flow.

- After making changes to a file and you are ready to commit / push to your repo you can run the following commands:

  - `git add .` - stages modifed files to be committed.
  - `git status` - displays files that have been modified
  - `git commit -m 'A helpfuly commit message'` - commits the changes to your local repo. Get in the habit now of making helpfull commit messages
  - `git push` - pushes your local commits to your github repo!

- To pull down changes that your partner pushed to the repo you simply have to run:
  - `git pull` - this will fetch the most recent updates!
